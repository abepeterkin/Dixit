help button: little question mark that pops a modal with rules, go to current phase with rules but allow other rules
score board: little a big scoring board, little one is just rabbits with name and score and big one is the whole thing, maybe have an arrow if people wanna toggle it.
voting: glowing space waiting, when cards are big enough no modal window
advanced: card sounds for looking through cards
